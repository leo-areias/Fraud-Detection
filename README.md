# **Fraud Detection on Transactions**
The objective of this analysis, is to develop a model that can be capable of identifing if a transaction is a fraud or not.
For this we are going to be doing the following steps:


*   Exploratory Analysis;
*   Finding the features that have an important imoact to the fraud detecion;
*   Presenting the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision and recall scores;
*   Develop models based on the KNN, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms;
*   Make ajustments to the models so it can have a improved performance.
